# String Concatenate

## Article Section

In JavaScript strings can be linked (or **concatenate**) together to make a sentence or phrase.

The word **concatenate** means: link (things) together in a chain or series.

The `+` operator you use for adding numbers can also be used to **concatenate** strings.

For example:

```
var str = 'Hello' + ' ' + 'World';
str; // 'Hello World'
```

You can also use variables defined by strings to concatenate them together.

```
var greet = 'Hello';
var name = 'Wayne';

var str = greet + ' ' + name;
str; // 'Hello Wayne'
```

## DIY Section

Now it's your turn to concatenate strings.

Two variables are already defined: `greet` is `'Hello'` and `name` is `'Bruce'`.

Put these strings together to make a sentence that says `'Hello there, Bruce!'`.

You **MUST** use `greet` and `name` variable to create the sentence.

- `str` should be equal to `'Hello there, Bruce!'`
